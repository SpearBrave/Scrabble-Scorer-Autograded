// Recall that for...in loops iterate over the keys within an object.

// If you need a reminder of how to assign new key/value pairs, review the relevant section in the Objects and Math chapter.

// To access the letter arrays within oldPointStructure, use bracket notation (oldPointStructure['key']).

// To access a particular element within a letter array, add a second set of brackets (oldPointStructure['key'][index]), or assign the array to a variable and use variableName[index].
